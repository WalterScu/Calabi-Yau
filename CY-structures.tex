At the end of last section, we introduced \textbf{n-Calabi-Yau categories} and weak Calabi-Yau structures on them. Kontsenvich discussed the notion of Calabi-Yau category in setting of $A_\infty$ in his well-known paper \ref{} and Victor Ginzburg defined Calabi-Yau algebras in another way for associative algberas, which is not equivalent to Kontsenvich's definition in general except some cases. Major missions for this section is to compare the difference between these two definitions and try to offer a more general treatment of Calabi-Yau structures.
