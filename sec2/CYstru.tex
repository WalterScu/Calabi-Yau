A weak Calabi-Yau structure is not strong enough to describe the 'Calabi-Yau properties' for a (DG) category. Now we introduce an enrichment suggested in \ref{}.
\begin{mydefn}
	An \textbf{$n$-Calabi-Yau structure} on a DG-category $\mathcal{A}$ is a negative cyclic class $[\tilde{\gamma_{\mathcal{A}}}] \in HC_n^{-}(\mathcal{A})$ which induces a weak $n$-Calabi-Yau structure on $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{mydefn}
